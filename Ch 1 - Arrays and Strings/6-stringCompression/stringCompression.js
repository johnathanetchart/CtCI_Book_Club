//Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa would become 'a2b1c5a3'. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)

function stringCompression(str) {
  //I'd put the code here
}

module.exports = stringCompression;
