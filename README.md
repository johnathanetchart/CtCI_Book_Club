Javascript prompts and solutions as well as testing for every question in Cracking The Coding Interview

Make sure to read the chapter before you start answering the questions!

Before tests will work, you will need to run `npm install`
Then just run `npm test` or `npm test <file path>` to only test one file

The solutions are all in the Sol file, but don't cheat! You'll be missing out on valuable learning opportunities!

There's also a hints file for each question, I'd recommend reading all of the hints after you find your own solution, 
they provide some good insights as to other solutions to the problems, and potentially more efficient ways of solving them
